# User REST API

It manages the users of the demo application.

In order to access to this API is needed to user Basic Auth. The users must also have the role ADMIN.

## REST API documentation

Generated by swagger, and available in the URL path: _/swagger-ui.html#/user-controller_.

## Health check

Available in the port 8091, in the URL path: _/actuator/health_.

## Execute with docker-compose

With the docker-compose.yml file we can execute the database together with the application.

Note that the image user-app must be already be build (see [README.md](../README.md)).

The parameters to execute the application image and the database are in the file .env.

Once the container with both images is created it will be needed to access to the database and create the first admin user. To do that:
* Open a client console to the db container.
* Access to the database: `psql -h db -U dbUser demo_db`
* Create the user in the table user-info with role ADMIN.
