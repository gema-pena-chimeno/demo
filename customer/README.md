# Customer REST API

It manages the customers of the demo application.

In order to access to this API is needed to user Basic Auth. 

The users can have the roles USER or ADMIN.

## REST API documentation

Generated by swagger is available in the link: /swagger-ui.html#/customer-controller

## Execute CustomerApplication in local

Take a look [LocalTesting.md](../LocalTesting.md) to configure the database.

Also add this parameter to save the images of the user:
_IMAGE_FOLDER = ${HOME}/image-data/_

And this one to create the URL to access to them:
_URL_PATH=/image-data_

## Execute with docker-compose

With the docker-compose.yml file we can execute the database together with the application.

Note that the image customer-app must be already be build (see [README.md](../README.md))

The parameters to execute the application image and the database are in the file .env.

Once the container with both images is created it will be needed to access to the database and create the first admin user. To do that:
* Open a client console to the db container.
* Access to the database: `psql -h db -U dbUser demo_db`
* Create the user in the table user-info with role ADMIN.
